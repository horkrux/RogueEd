RogueEd is planned to be a level editor for Star Wars Rogue Squadron. In its current form it only supports viewing the levels and has next to no UI. While many models and features like flight paths can be viewed, my knowledge of the game's formats is still limited in certain areas, so not all of them will appear correctly.
Since this was a learning project for DX11, much of the engine followed the structure described in a tutorial and, like most of the codebase, is very much WIP.
